# Everyday Flask
Welcome to the Flask Repository for everyday coding. We're learning Flask for a few reasons. First of which is that it is quite Pythonic in the sense that the way you do things is pretty explicit. Flask requires, perhaps, more work to build a complicated web application, and it certainly is not  "batteries included" in the same way that Django is, but I believe that if you learn Flask well, it will be not so difficult to add Django to your programming utility belt.  

This repository will hold the sample code and completed examples from each week's class. I have created a unique branch for the work that you will be doing each week. I realize you could simply clone the code from each branch and submit that, but you wouldn't learn anything and when you have quizzes and have to develop your own app, you will not be successful. Instead, I encourage you to productively struggle through each week's assignments. Then once you have finished, come visit the branch and figure out what went wrong or what went right. Likewise, after I give you feedback, you can compare your code with this code to better understand what I mean. Finally, since the work is cummulative, if you just don't get a concept, you can take code from this repository so that you have a non-broken app as you move on to the next week.

There will be a great deal of information on the Canvas pages for our class for each week. As such, the code here may not be significantly marked up or commented. Likewise, since this is an open repository, you will be allowed to make pull requests. At the end of the class, if you've seen significant areas where this repository could be improved, make and test those improvements in a new branch with your name. Then issue a pull request making sure you justify the changes you've made. I will assess those changes, and if I incorporate your changes, I will add you to the list of contributors. 

To get started, feel free to clone this repository:
```git
git clone https://github.com/dlondonmedina/everyday.git
